# Project Run Instructions

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AjayPudasaini/find_match
    ```

2. Setup virtual environment:

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    On Linux/macOS:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    On Windows:
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the FastAPI Code

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd find_match
    ```

2. Run the FastAPI code:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. Once the server is running, visit [localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) in your web browser to access the Swagger UI for interacting with the API.

## Important Note

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system and that the required dependencies are installed in your virtual environment before running the FastAPI code.
